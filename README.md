# SMS-SPAM-PROJECT
The SMS Spam Detection App is a machine learning project that classifies SMS messages as either spam or not spam. The app uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques and a pre-trained model to predict whether a given SMS message is spam. This project demonstrates the power of machine learning and text classification using real-world data.
